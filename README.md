# 🛡️ STIP - Smart Threat Intelligence Platform

**STIP** is an open-source, real-time threat intelligence automation tool built for security researchers, SOC analysts, red/blue teamers, and cybersecurity learners. It automates the collection, classification, scoring, and export of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from publicly available OSINT sources — with zero cost and full transparency.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Collect IOCs** (IP addresses, domains, hashes, URLs) from OSINT sources like Pastebin, OTX, AbuseIPDB, and more
- 🧠 **Classify and score IOCs** using custom threat scoring logic based on type, reputation, and source
- 📦 **Store results** in MongoDB or flat files (JSON/CSV)
- 💻 **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for collection, analysis, export, and querying
- 🧾 **Export IOCs and reports** in CSV, JSON, or human-readable text
- 🧩 **Modular and extensible** architecture — plug in new sources or scoring modules easily
